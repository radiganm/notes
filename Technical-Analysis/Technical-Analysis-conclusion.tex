\chapter{Concluding Remarks}

Technical indicators should not be used in isolation, but rather used to add support to estimations of the market.  Many technical indicators work best when the market follows the established patterns they were intended to model.  When the market takes an unexpected turn, indicators may at fail altogether, or lag too far in time to react profitably.  However, when applied intelligently they enhance the investors understanding of both individual stock signals and the broader market, and can be the building blocks for the development of a valuable trading system.
